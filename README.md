MCProxy Software

GLOBAL INFORMATION
=========
MCProxy is a very advanced Minecraft server proxy I am currently working on. The project is currently using protocol version 47, which means that only Minecraft 1.8 clients will be able to connect. The project is far from finished so you can't really use it for something useful yet.
